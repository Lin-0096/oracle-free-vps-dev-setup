# ‚òÅÔ∏è Oracle Cloud Free VPS Setup for C Development

This guide walks you through setting up a free Debian 12 VPS on Oracle Cloud, perfect for remote C/C++ development using VS Code.

---

## üìå Prerequisites

- Oracle Cloud account (sign up [here](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/))
- Credit card for verification
- Visual Studio Code with the [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) extension
- Debian 12 Image (I am using `debian-12-generic-amd64.qcow2`, [download](https://cloud.debian.org/images/cloud/bookworm/latest/))
---


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Register on Oracle Cloud official website if you don‚Äôt have an account.
- You need to bind a credit card during registration.
- The VPS personal basic service is permanently free, but some features are paid.
- Be careful not to exceed the free usage limits to avoid charges.
- Start with the minimal configuration needed, and expand later if necessary.

---

## üåç Selecting Your Home Region

After account registration and logging in, you will be prompted to select your **Home Region**.  
Your Home Region is where your resources and services will be primarily hosted.

- Choose a region **closest to your physical location** for better latency and performance.  
- For users in Finland, regions like **Frankfurt (eu-frankfurt-1)** or **Stockholm (eu-stockholm-1)** are good choices.  
- The Home Region can be changed later, but it requires additional steps, so pick carefully.

## üíø Pre-step: Create a Custom Image

### 1. Create an Object Storage Bucket

Log in to the Oracle Cloud Console, navigate to Object Storage, and create a new Bucket to store the image file.
- Choose a meaningful and unique bucket name, e.g., `images`

![create_bucket](/screenshots/nevigate_buckets.png)
![create_bucket](/screenshots/create_bucket.png)
![create_bucket1](/screenshots/create_bucket1.png)

---

### 2. Upload the Image File to the Bucket
In the Object Storage page, select the created bucket and upload the Debian image file.
![import_custom_images](/screenshots/upload_image_file.png)

---

### 3. Create a Custom Image Using the Uploaded File
![import_custom_images](/screenshots/import_custom_images.png)
![import_custom_images1](/screenshots/import_custom_images1.png)

---

### (Optional) 4. Edit Image Details

Edit your image details to include A1 shape.

![edit_custom_image_details](/screenshots/edit_custom_image_details.png)
![add_A1_shape](/screenshots/add_A1_shape.png)

You can use the same method to create and upload any custom images you want to install on your VPS.

### 5. Create Virtual Cloud Networks

### 6. Create Subnets

### 7. Create Internet Getways

### 8. Create Routing

## üèóÔ∏è Step-by-Step: Creating a VPS on Oracle Cloud
### 1. Log in and Navigate to **Compute > Instances**

![nevigate_instances](/screenshots/nevigate_instances.png)

---

### 2. Click **Create Instance**

![create_instance](/screenshots/create_instance.png)

---

### 3. Basic Info & Shape Selection

- **Name**: `<your_server_name>`
- **Image**: Debian image (custom image which you just created in pre-step)
- **Shape**:  
  - `VM.Standard.A1.Flex` (Ampere ARM ‚Äî Always Free)  
    Due to its better performance, this shape often runs at full capacity, which can sometimes prevent instance creation.  
  - `VM.Standard.E2.1.Micro` (AMD ‚Äî Always Free)  
    The E2 shape can be used as an alternative. For the 42 project, there is not much difference between the two. For free instances, why ask for a bike? (I mean for more?)

![create_shape2](/screenshots/create_shape2.png)
---

### 4. Networking Settings

- **Create new virtual cloud network (VCN)**
- **Create new public subnet**
- Enable **Public IPv4 Address**
- Subnet Access: **Public**

---

### 5. SSH Key

- Download your **SSH private key**

![download_private_key](/screenshots/download_private_key.png)

---

### 6.Storage 
- Boot volume:
  - Size: `50 GB`
  - VPU: `10`

### 7. Review and Create

## üñ•Ô∏è Connect to Your VPS from VS Code

You can check your **Public IP** after creating instance successfully:
![check_ip](/screenshots/check_ip.png)


Use the [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) plugin.

Example SSH config (`~/.ssh/config`):

```ssh
Host <Your Server Name>
  HostName <Your Public IP>
  User debian
  IdentityFile <key file>
```

Then connect using:

```bash
ssh <Your Server Name>
```

example:
![check_ip](/screenshots/ssh.png)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Install C Development Tools

Copy [`install-dev-tools.sh`](/scripts/install-dev-tools.sh) to your VPS:

Then run the script:

```bash
chmod +x install-dev-tools.sh
./install-dev-tools.sh
```

It will update&upgrade old packages and install C Development Tools(gcc, g++, make, git, gdb, clang, valgrind) and file navigation and terminal tools...

---

## ‚úÖ Done!

You now have a free VPS running Debian 12 with C development tools installed, accessible remotely via SSH through VS Code.  
No more confusing discrepancies between your environment and the 42 school's setup!

Enjoy, and you're very welcome!
